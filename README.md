# Description

Clone the program to your local machine, and add a new **Button** element to the application, and set its properties to the following values:

- `x:Name`: `CloseBtn`
- `Text`: `Close`
- `HorizontalOptions`: `Fill`

**You only have to edit the XAML file.**

**Check:** If the program runs successfully without throwing any exceptions then your task is correct.
